Synthetic Job Application Email Generator
==========================================
Generates a large, class-balanced dataset of realistic job application emails
for training the classifier. Each email is generated from templates with
randomized company names, roles, applicant names, dates, and natural variation.

Target: ~2000 emails with roughly equal class distribution:
  - acceptance:      300
  - rejection:       400
  - interview:       350
  - action_required: 350
  - in_process:      400
  - unrelated:       200
